This project aims to create a XHTML compliant slideshow
that supports text captioning that will failover
correctly on disabled javascript, images, or CSS.

This caption bar will fade in on a slide transition
and itself uses a alpha transparent PNG to reveal the
photo behind.  Note that in IE the alpha system is
quirky and it's just easier to remove the fade.

Inspiration for this project comes from Revision3's 2009
homepage look that is built similarly but not W3C
compliant.

I include 5 color samples in a sprite to demo that function.

I use the jQuery.Cycle.lite plugin for the slideshow itself
http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/

While the slideshow itself will work in IE6, the transparency will
fail.

If you run this code agaisnt w3.org's validator,
the CC attribution boxes may fail.  That's outside
the scope of the project.
